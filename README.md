# CSS Portfolio

## 1st Edition

Built a starting portfolio page to add to during the rest of the course. Added nav bar with anchor links as well as contact links out of the site.

Showcases some of my work with placeholders for new projects. Tasteful but interactive design meant to convey professionalism.
